# HackerGuilds Legacy

The legacy codebase of HackerGuilds. We hope to revive the once thriving community of this game by updating the codebase to remove some of the issues, such as the memory leak issues, as well as to reduce the effectiveness of cheating tools such as HExBot. We also hope to add some new mechanics to the game, as well as to update some of the UI elements in order to bring this game to a much more relevant state.


Documentation can be found at the `info/` folder. Keep in mind it might be outdated, but it's better than nothing.


## Setup

Legacy uses PHP 5 and MySQL, alongside some Python 2 scripts running on cron jobs. You can build the database schema from the `game.sql` file. A model of the cron file can be found at `crontab`.

If you have questions and/or need help setting it up or understanding its code, please open an issue. Your question may be someone else's, so do not hesitate asking it. I can't guarantee fast responses, but I'll try to help you as soon as possible.

Make sure to scan the code for the words `REDACTED` and `2019`. `REDACTED` will contain placeholders for API keys and passwords that you might want to change. `2019` may contain useful comments.

## License

Legacy is published under the MIT license, as described in the `LICENSE` file. You can run your own private game server and display ads or charge money however you like, with no ties to me and/or DKTech.

The MIT license does not give you the right to use the brand HackerGuilds commercially, which is a registered trademark. In other words, please do not name your game server "HackerGuilds Continued" or anything like that. As always, [fair usage](https://support.google.com/legal/answer/4558992?hl=en), like mentioning it's based on Legacy, is OK.

## Images

I did not include with the source code most of the images and icons used in the game. You should get them yourself and make sure you understand the attribution requirements.

Most of the game icons were from the amazing [famfamfam](http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/) iconset. You can use it as long as you credit it.
